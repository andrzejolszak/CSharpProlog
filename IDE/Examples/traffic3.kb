% The rules are valid Prolog terms, defined using
% operators.  The syntax is made more friendly for
% non-Prolog programmers using the properNames, and
% properQuotes options of Amzi! for allowing an
% alternate syntax.
%
% That alternate syntax delimits strings using ", instead
% of ` or $. It also allows atoms to begin with upper case
% letters, and it only uses a leading _ to define variables.
